    Hu and Varas (WP, 2021) A Theory of Zombie Lending: REPLICATION
    
    This code replicates Figure 2 (Paanel A and Panel B) of Hu and Varas (2021). 
    The left panel shows the joint valuations of the entrepreneur and the bank,
    the right one only shows those of the bank. In this example, tb = 1.2921 and tg = 2.1006.
    
    In the figure, the red, blue, and green lines represent the value functions of the
    informed-good, the uninformed, and the informed-bad types, respectively.
